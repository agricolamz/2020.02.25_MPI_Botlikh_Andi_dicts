# Phonological description: data-driven analysis

|   | Traditional analysis              | Data-driven analysis                                         |
|---|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. | Done by trained linguist          | Evaluated by trained linguist                                |
| 2. | Can be done from scratch          | Previous description needed (or at least prior expectations) |
| 3. | Doesn’t care about amount of data | Care more about amount of data                               |
| 4. | Less reproducible                 | More reproducible                                            |
| 5. | Can not be automated              | Can be automated                                             |

Data-driven approach to phonological description and syllable structure analysis:

* was proposed in [@moroz2018]
* was applied to syllable structure  in [@moroz2019] to Adyghe data
* was applied to syllable structure in [@romanova2019] to Russian and Macedonian data

# Phonological description: data-driven analysis

The main steps:

* start with some language corpus (corpus, dictionary etc.)
* automatically extract phonological units (segments, features, syllable structure etc.) \pause

Further steps:

* obtained frequencies and inventories could be compared with the same units from other languages \pause

Advantages:

* more reproducible
* could be updated with new data, see ([Moroz 2019](https://github.com/agricolamz/2019.08.21-25_SLE_Leipzig/raw/master/2019.08.21-25_SLE_Leipzig.pdf))  slides from SLE on Bayesian typological research
* answers the question *'How often is X present in language(s)?'* rather than *'Is X present in language(s)?'*
